# ADR 11: Test Case Documentation Structure

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The system requires a standardized format for documenting test cases to ensure consistency, completeness, and clarity. Test case documentation serves as a bridge between business requirements, use cases, and actual test implementations.

## Challenges
- Maintaining consistency across test documentation
- Ensuring all necessary information is captured
- Providing clear traceability to requirements and use cases
- Supporting different types of test scenarios
- Balancing detail with maintainability
- Making test cases easy to review and execute

## Decision
Implementation of a standardized test case documentation structure.

### Test Case Document Structure

```markdown
# Test Case Identifier

## Description
Clear description of what aspect of the system is being tested and why.

## References
### Use Case
- Link to related use case(s)

### Requirements
- Links to related business/functional/non-functional requirements

### Assumptions
- Links to related assumptions that affect this test case

## Prerequisites
- List of conditions that must be met before test execution
- System state requirements
- Data requirements
- External system requirements (if any)

## Test Data
- Detailed specification of test data
- Input values
- Configuration requirements
- External system responses (if applicable)

## Test Steps
1. Detailed step-by-step execution plan
2. Each step should be atomic and verifiable
3. Include setup steps if not covered by prerequisites
4. Include cleanup steps if required

## Expected Results
- Detailed description of expected system behavior
- Specific validation points
- Success criteria
- State changes to verify

## Notes
- Any additional information relevant to test execution
- Known limitations or special conditions
- Cleanup requirements
- Performance expectations (if applicable)
```

### Documentation Rules
1. All sections are mandatory unless explicitly marked optional
2. Prerequisites must be specific and verifiable
3. Test steps must be atomic and numbered
4. Expected results must map to specific test steps
5. References must use relative links
6. Test data should be specific enough to be reproducible

## Consequences

### Positive
- Consistent test documentation across the project
- Complete information for test execution
- Clear traceability to requirements
- Easier test review process
- Better test maintenance
- Clearer validation criteria

### Negative
- More time required for test documentation
- Higher maintenance overhead
- Need for regular documentation updates
- Training required for consistent usage

## Implementation Notes
- Create documentation template
- Add documentation checks to review process
- Consider automated validation of documentation structure
- Maintain test case documentation alongside code
- Regular reviews of documentation completeness
