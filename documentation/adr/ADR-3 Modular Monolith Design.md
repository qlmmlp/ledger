# ADR 3: Modular Monolith Design

## Status
Accepted

## Context
A maintainable, future-proof system architecture is required that allows potential decomposition into microservices while maintaining simplicity of deployment and development in the initial phase. The system's complexity necessitates clear boundaries between functional areas while preserving the benefits of monolithic deployment.

## Challenges
- Need for clear isolation between different functional areas
- Risk of tight coupling between modules
- Complexity of defining proper module boundaries
- Balance between flexibility and development speed
- Need for clear contracts between modules
- Protection of module internals from external access
- Future maintainability and extensibility requirements

## Decision
The system is implemented as a modular monolith with strict isolation between functional areas.

### Module Structure
- Each module is encapsulated as a distinct bounded context
- Module internals are completely hidden from other modules
- Each module maintains its own domain model
- Direct access to module internals is prohibited
- Module implementation details are encapsulated

### Communication Patterns
- FACADE interfaces are utilized for synchronous operations
- Events are employed for asynchronous operations
- Public and internal APIs are strictly separated
- Inter-module communication is restricted to defined interfaces
- Direct calls to module internals are forbidden

## Consequences

### Positive
- Simpler initial development and deployment
- Clear boundaries between different parts of the system
- Improved maintainability and testability
- Facilitated future migration to microservices
- Enhanced code organization
- Controlled technical debt

### Negative
- Strict module boundaries enforcement required
- Potential for inappropriate coupling if not carefully managed
- Module interface design complexity
- Careful event design required
- Increased upfront design effort
- Additional boilerplate code for interfaces
- Educational overhead for developers

## Implementation Notes
- Symfony's bundle system is utilized for module separation
- Strict dependency rules are implemented between modules
- Clear interface contracts are established
- Dependency injection is employed for module communication
- Module internal classes are marked as final and @internal
- Public API is explicitly marked with annotations
- Automated tests verify module isolation
